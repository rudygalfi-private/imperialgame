= Introduction =

This guide details a set of steps you can take to enlist in the project. It is highly recommended that you follow these steps to get up and running quickly, but you are *not required* to do so.

= Development Environment =

Use Visual C# 2008 Express Edition for development. You'll get some nice features like IntelliSense as well as consistency with the core build process.

= Local File Location =

Choose a directory on your local system to use for holding the source code and compiled binaries. These are some recommended ones based on your OS:

  * On Windows XP: {{{C:\Code\Imperial\}}}
  * On Windows Vista: {{{C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Code\Imperial}}}
  * On Windows 7: {{{C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Code\Imperial}}}

If you wish to use something else, the directory should have a path with the following characteristics:

  * Short
  * Contain no spaces
  * Local to your user account

We'll call whatever directory you choose {{{PROJROOT}}}.

Within {{{PROJROOT}}}, you'll have the following directory structure:

{{{
PROJROOT
PROJROOT\imperialgame
PROJROOT\imperialgame\*bin*
PROJROOT\imperialgame\*obj*
PROJROOT\imperialgame\*{source files}*_
PROJROOT\imperialgame\*Imperial.csproj*_
PROJROOT\imperialgame\*Imperial.csproj.user*
PROJROOT\*Imperial.sln*
}}}

*Imperial.sln* is a Visual Studio (VS) file that you can use to open up the project within VS. A solution can actually contain many projects, but we'll just have one.

(And its name is...) *Imperial.csproj* is a file specific to the project. If you open it up, you'll see it contains a bunch of information related to the build process. We'll be examining this file later on. *Imperial.csproj.user* is a relatively unimportant file that contains user settings.

The *bin* directory contains the executables generated by the build process.

The *obj* directory contains intermediate files from the build process. Files in this directory can be helpful in performing an incremental rather than full build.

*{source files}* describes all of the source files. In the future, this may actually be a collection of directories and subdirectories containing source files, but for now it's just a collection of files.

The italicized items above are those that are part of the source control scheme

= Source Control =
As we're using Google Code, the source control system we're using is Subversion (a.k.a. "SVN" or "svn"). You can make your life easy by downloading and installing a Windows shell extension that lets you manage all interactions with SVN via Windows Explorer.
