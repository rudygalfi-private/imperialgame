#summary A listing of the game objects we have or will need.
#labels Featured

Money (implemented on uint in units of millions -- should we make this into its own class for type safety?)

MoneyCollection (can deposit, withdraw, zero, transfer, etc.)

Bond (struct of {CountryName, FaceValue, InterestPayment})

BondCollection (the set of bonds that a player or country possesses)

BondMarket (the set of all bonds)

Implementation of bonds is tough:
  * Countries have a BondCollection and Players have a BondCollection. Bonds can move between collections.
  * There is a single BondMarket and Bonds have another property, Owner, which negates the need for BondCollections
  * Hybrid: BondMarket is a glorified BondCollection and Players have their own BondCollection (so bonds that players own are not in the "Market" -- might be the most realistic)
