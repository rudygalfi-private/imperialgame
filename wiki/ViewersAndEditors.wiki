#summary Some other code viewers and editors to consider using.

= Introduction =

There's a case to be made for using some non-default viewers/editors.

= Diffing and Merging =

Consider using SourceGear's DiffMerge. It is lightweight and has a decent interface.

Download: http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html

To set it up:

Right-click on any source file to expose the TortoiseSVN menu. Click on Settings.

In the left-hand navigation, find the External Programs section.

  * Under Diff Viewer, there are two places to select "External" and enter a path of C:\Program Files (x86)\SourceGear\DiffMerge\DiffMerge.exe. (Substitute your own path to the location of DiffMerge.exe if needed.)
  * UnderMerge too, there is one place to select "External" and enter a path of C:\Program Files (x86)\SourceGear\DiffMerge\DiffMerge.exe. (Substitute your own path to the location of DiffMerge.exe if needed.

Now, when you select any diff or merge action within TortoiseSVN, it will launch this (better) program!

= Text Editors =

Consider Notepad2 for the miscellaneous quick text editing (options files like .csproj).
